    <p>
        Since I was young, I have always had a passion for learning.
        I began taking high school accredited classes in 8th grade.
        I now take multiple AP and honors courses. My first PSAT score was a 1020 which I hope to improve in the future.
        I also attend a secondary school called “The Center for Advancing Research and Technology.”
        Everything that we learn can give an overlook of many career paths by experiencing them hands on.

    <h2>Post-secondary Plan</h2>
    <p> I plan to apply to many schools, in California and outside of the state as well.
        As I start to look into college, I look for things like student care, cleanliness, safety, etc.
        I’m still undecided on what major I want to declare, however Computer Science, Psychology, and Business are all
        a few majors that I’m considering. Although these are very important to me, enjoying my time while I’m there is
        also a priority. After college I hope to secure a strong position in a company.
