  <p>I enjoy watching sports, reading, and listening to music.
    Since I was young I have been playing sports,
    I've played football, baseball, and basketball.
    My favorite football team is the Saints, and my favorite basketball
    team is OKC. </p>

  <p>I enjoy reading because I'm able to visualize the book in my head,
    when I am engulfed in my book it can feel like watching a movie.
    I enjoy non-fiction, sci-fi, and self-help books.

    A few of my favorite artists from the genre plugg are Lucki, Autumn!, Iayze, and Veeze.
     I also enjoy R&B, Some of my favorite artists are Brent Faiyaz, and Future.
