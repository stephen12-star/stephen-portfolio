    <h1>Portfolo</h1>
    <p>We learned how to code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also pair those with figma to plan our code. Learning
        code wasn’t easy at first and is still a struggle as I learn. The CART Habits of Mind helped guide my work and
        allowed me to work with others successfully and effectively. Learning to manage code for the first time is like
        barely learning how to read and getting a dictionary. The longer you stay invested in the book the more words
        you know. I'm learning new techniques daily to make me a better coder. We also learned the type of traits we
        carry and how we can incorporate them to work with others’ traits.
