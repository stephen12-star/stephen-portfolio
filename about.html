    <p>
        Since I was young, I have always had a passion for learning.
        I began taking high school accredited classes in 8th grade.
        I now take multiple AP and honors courses. My first PSAT score was a 1020 which I hope to improve in the future.
        I also attend a secondary school called “The Center for Advancing Research and Technology.”
        Everything that we learn can give an overlook of many career paths by experiencing them hands on.
